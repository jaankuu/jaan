## Hey there, thanks for stopping by!

I am Jaan, originally from Estonia, currently living in The Netherlands. I am currently honing my Full Stack Development skills at Codaisseur Academy, where the stack is built on Javascript, including React & Redux, HTML5 & CSS, and to give a foundation to these, we use Node, Express, Sequelize, and PostgreSQL.

I have a background in sciences, where a beginning in psychology led me towards programming across years. Additionally I have experience in Python, statistics, research (and research design), and interaction design. I feel like solving coding problems starting from an idea to implementation provides the enjoyment of breakthroughs from using logical thinking, some creativity, and of course... Google.

You can find me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jaan-kuusaru-0803971ba/) if you feel like writing me!
